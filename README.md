## Overview

[Welcome](https://get.src.run/go/readme_welcome)!
The `src-run/augustus-polyfill-library` package provides
a single metapackage that wraps all polyfill implementations.

### Grouping

This package is part of the [augustus](https://get.src.run/augustus-polyfill-library/group)
group ([explanation](https://get.src.run/augustus-polyfill-library/group_explanation)),
comprised of other releases with a concentration in 
*core reflection base classes*,
and related functionality.

### JTT

This package represents a single project within a
[large collection](https://get.src.run/go/explore) of open-source code released
under the *SR* namespace, comprised of framework-agnostic libraries,
and a number of Symfony bundles. These projects are authored and maintained
by [Rob Frawley 2nd](https://get.src.run/rmf) and 
[collaborators](https://get.src.run/augustus-polyfill-library/github_collaborators).
